# Global Instructions & Workflow

## Workflow & Git Strategy
- **Branching:** Never work directly on `main`. Always create a new feature branch from `main` before making any changes. 
- **Source of Truth:** Treat `main` as the absolute source of truth. Before starting a task, ensure the local `main` is synced with remote and branch off it.
- **Syncing:** Whenever a new chat opens or multiple models are invoked, your first action must be to verify the current branch and ensure the codebase state matches the latest accepted changes from `main` or the active feature branch.
- **Commit:** Commit and push to origin from the feature branch.

## Research & Knowledge
- **Credibility:** Only refer to credible sources: Official Documentation, StackOverflow, Peer-reviewed Research Papers, Medium (Technical), and Notion/Internal Docs.
- **Confidence Threshold:** Do not suggest solutions, libraries, or logic where your confidence in the correctness is less than **85%**. If unsure, state the uncertainty clearly.

## Implementation Constraints
- **Strict Scope:** Do not implement features or logic that were not explicitly asked for.
- **Permission-Based:** Do not start implementing/writing code until the user has explicitly given the "Go ahead" or "Implement" command. Provide plans or pseudocode first if the task is complex. Make sure whatever is being implemented follows real-worl production standards.

## Engineering Standards
- **Style:** No sugar-coating. Be direct and concise.
- **Simplicity:** Prioritize simplicity. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Principles:** Strictly follow industry standards:
    - **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - **SOLID** Principles
    - **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

## Context Synchronization
- At the start of every session or when multiple models are invoked, perform a "Context Check": Verify the current file state and Git status to ensure all models are operating on the same workspace version.

### Phase 1: High-Level Definition
- Understand the problem at a high level and clarify all requirements.
- Produce a high-level design.
- Documentation location: `docs/High-Level.md`.

### Phase 2: Low-Level Design
- Expand each requirement with detailed design and flow.
- Define interfaces/services and their contracts.
- Documentation location: `docs/Low-Level.md`.

### Phase 3: Development Plan and Execution
- Break work into smaller phases and user stories.
- Define tasks and implementation steps.
- Documentation location: `docs/Tasks.md`.

## Testing Discipline
- With each internal phase of Phase 3, add test cases to prevent regressions as new functionality is introduced and also consider edge cases.
